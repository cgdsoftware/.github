### Support services (new)
While developing genealogy, we constantly received private inquiries from devs and teams asking us about paid support. Some of these requests even lead to fruitful collaborations, so we finally decided to launch such an option.

If you're looking for premium support when building applications with genealogy we can help you with that. Our support packages start at Â£500 / month with 8 hours included. With premium support you will get:

a private repo on our self hosted gitlab instance where you can host your project

priority in addressing your issues

help with understanding the environment

getting you to be proficient when developing on our projects

mentoring

code reviews

general advice & support on Laravel & Vue

assistance on version upgrades

direct communication via Slack during our office hours

The support services are provided by a team of 4 members.
